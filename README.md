## What is MRR
Multi rotor research business model is to make drones easyer for industrila use without the need of a drone operator. They have created a sofisticated software which controls the drone to follow a desicgneted path pointed from the user. The main task of the drones is to take a lot of images that are then inputed in to 3d modeling software where variouse of services can be performed Figure 1 and 2 such as distance mesurmanets and inspection of mariouse object such as rooftops and road inspection.

## My role in the project 

I was part of this project in semester 7th of my ICT study i was part of the team developing MRR drones platform from where all of the data and control of the drones was happening. The back-end of the platform was written with C# .Net and the front-end was React.js. The tasks for this semester where to fix existing bugs and develop new features that would help the user-experience and performance of the drone missions. 

### Task 1 

My first task was to imporve the "Marketplace" which was part of the platfrom where the admin can add new apps for drone missions. The purpouse of the apps is to add additional functionality
to the drone missions when the user starts a drone mission he will be able to choose an app that can help the drone in a specific way such apps can be AI models made specifically for trash or rust detection mission
