## What is MRR
Multi rotor research was a project that i was part of in my 7th semester of my ICT study. The business model of this company is to make drones easyer for industrila use without the need of a drone operator. They have created a sofisticated software which controls the drone to follow a desicgneted path pointed from the user. The main task of the drones is to take a lot of images that are then inputed in to 3d modeling software where variouse of services can be performed Figure 1 and 2 such as distance mesurmanets and inspection of mariouse object such as rooftops and road inspection.
